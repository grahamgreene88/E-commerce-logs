The goal of this project is to gain insight on customer behaviour by analyzing patterns and trends in orders from an e-commerce website. The orders are analyzed on a per country basis to determine which countries should be focused on for sale improvements. Metrics like average order value (AOV) and percent of orders returned are compared to the global average to determine which countries warrant further investigation to improve sale performance.
